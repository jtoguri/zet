# Proof By Contradiction

Correctness of algorithms can be prooved by contradiction.

The basic scheme of a contradiction argument is as follows:
* assume that the hypothesis (the statement you want to prove) is false
* develop some logical consequences of this assumption
* show that one consequence is demonstrably false, thereby showing that the assumption is incorrect and the hypothesis is true

For a contradiction argument to be convincing, the final consequence must be clearly, ridiculously false. Muddy outcomes are not convincing. It is also important that this contradiction be a logical consequence of the assumption.

Euclid's proof that there are an infinite number of prime numbers is a classic contradiction argument.
