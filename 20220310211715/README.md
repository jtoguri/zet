# What is a database?

A database is an organized collection of data, usually controlled by a database management system ([20220310214343](https://github.com/jtoguri/zet/tree/main/20220310214343)).

## Three main types of databases

* **Flat file database**: stores data in flat files, very simple with no explicit relationships between records, can be plain text file or binary file
* **Non-relational database** (NoSQL): do not use SQL, are minimally structured, data can be stored as key-value pair
* **Relational database**: database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another, items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows, items are linked based on defined relationships
