# Viewing File Contents With `less`

> The less command is a program to view text files. It provides a convenient way to examine files that contain human-readable text.
>
> The ability to examine text files is important because many of the files that contain system settings (called **configuration files**) are stored in this format. Being able to read them gives us insight about how the system works.
>
>In addition, some of the actual programs that the system uses (called **scripts**) are stored in this format.

>We have the ability to edit text files in order to modify systems settings and write our own scripts.
