# Linux vs GNU/Linux

> There is no completely correct way to name it because it was written by many different people in a vast, distributed development effort.
>
> Technically speaking, Linux is the name of the operating system's kernel. The kernel makes the operating system go, but it's not enough to form a complete operating system.
>
> Richard Stallman insists that you call it “GNU/Linux” to properly reflect the contributions of the GNU Project. While the GNU Project predates the Linux kernel, and the project's contributions deserving of recognition, placing them in the name is unfair to everyone else who made significant contributions. Besides, “Linux/GNU” would be more technically accurate since the kernel boots first and everything else runs on top of it.
