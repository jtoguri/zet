# CSS Preprocessor

A **CSS preprocessor** is a program that lets you *generate CSS* from the *preprocessor's own unique syntax*.

Most CSS preprocessors will *add some features that don't exist in pure CSS*, in order to make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.

To use a CSS preprocessor, you must either:
* install a CSS compiler on your web server, or
* use the CSS preprocessor to compile on the development environment, and then upload compiled CSS file to the web server.

A few of most popular CSS preprocessors:
* Sass \[[20220328132229](insertlinkhere.com)]

* PostCSS
