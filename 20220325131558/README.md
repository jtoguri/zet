# What is the shell?

> When we speak of the command line, we are really referring to the shell. The shell is a **program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system** to carry out.
>
>Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called bash. The name “bash” is an acronym for “Bourne Again SHell", a reference to the fact bash is an enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell program written by Steve Bourne.
>
> Besides bash, there are other shell programs available for Linux systems. These include: ksh, tcsh and zsh.
