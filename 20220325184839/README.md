# File System Tree

> Unix-like operating systems such as Linux organize files in what is called a ***hierarchical directory structure***. 

> This means they are organized in a tree-like pattern of ***directories*** (sometimes called folders in other systems), which may contain files and other directories.
>
> The first directory in the file system is called the ***root*** directory. The root directory contains files and subdirectories, which contain more files and subdirectories and so on.
>
> Unix-like systems such as Linux always have a single file system tree, regardless of how many drives or storage devices are attached to the computer. Storage devices are ***mounted*** at various points on the tree according to the whims of the person responsible for the maintenance of the system (systen administrator).
