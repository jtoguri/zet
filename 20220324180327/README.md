> The only way to really get anything done on a computer is by typing on a keyboard.
> Most computer users today are familiar only with the graphical user interface (GUI). This is unfortunate, because a good command line interface (CLI) is a marvelously expressive way of communicating with a computer in much the same way the written word is for human beings.

> It's been said that “graphical user interfaces make easy tasks easy, while command line interfaces make difficult tasks possible”.
