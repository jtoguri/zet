# Algorithmic Estimation

When you donâ€™t know the right answer, the best thing to do is guess. Principled guessing is called *estimation*. The ability to make back-of-the-envelope estimates of diverse quantities such as the running time of a program is a valuable skill in algorithm design, as it is in any technical enterprise.

Estimation problems are best solved through some kind of logical reasoning process, typically a mix of principled calculations and analogies.

**Principled calculations** give the answer as a function of quantities that either you already know, can look up on Google, or feel confident enough to guess.

**Analogies** reference your past experiences, recalling those that seem similar to some aspect of the problem at hand.

A best practice in estimation is to try to solve the problem in different ways and see if the answers generally agree in magnitude.
