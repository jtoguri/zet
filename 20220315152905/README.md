# Relationships Between Tables in a Database

The relationships between tables are based on ***primary keys*** and [***foreign keys***](https://github.com/jtoguri/zet/search?q=foreign+key). 

The two main types of relationships between tables are:

* **one-to-many relationship**: one record in one table is related to many records in another table
  * In a one-to-many relationship, the foreign key goes on the many side

* **many-to-many relationship**: many records in one table relate to many records in another table
