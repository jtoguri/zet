# Mathematical Induction

recursion is mathematical induction in action
Recursive descriptions of objects require both decomposition rules and basis cases, namely the specification of the smallest and simplest objects where the decomposition stops.
Learning to think recursively is learning to look for big things that are made from smaller things of exactly the same type as the big thing.
