# Abolute vs Relative Pathnames

> An ***absolute pathname*** begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch by branch until the path to the desired directory or file is completed.

> A ***relative pathname*** starts from the working directory. It uses a couple of special notations to represent relative positions in the file system tree:
> * "." (dot) refers to the working directory
> * ".." (dot dot) refers to the working directory's parent directory.
