# Database Design

**Database design** is the organization of data according to a database model.

A **database model** is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database.

The designer determines what data must be stored and how the data elements interrelate.

Database design involves ***classifying data*** and ***identifying interrelationships***. 

This theoretical representation of the data is called an **ontology**. The ontology is the theory behind the database's design.
