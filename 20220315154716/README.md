# Joining Tables

Also referred to as a ***junction table*** or ***bridging table***.

A joining table can be though of as being in the middle of two other tables. Breaking up a many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships.

It captures every instance of related data between the two tables.

It's common to name joining tables as a combination of both of their related tables (e.g. tableA_tableB). However, it's easier to identify what the table is doing if you come up with a name that better describes what's being recorded.
