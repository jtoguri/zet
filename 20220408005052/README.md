# What Is An Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a procedure to accomplish a specific task, it takes any of the possible input instances and transforms it to the desired output. 

An algorithm is the idea behind any reasonable computer program.

To be interesting, an algorithm must solve a *general*, *well-specified* **problem**. An algorithmic problem is specified by describing the complete set of *instances* it must work on and of its output after running on one of these instances. This distinction, between a problem and an instance of a problem, is fundamental.

The three desirable properties for good algorithms are that they are:
* correct
* efficient
* easy to implement

These goals may not be simultaneously achievable. In industrial settings, any program that seems to give good enough answers without slowing the application down is often acceptable, regardless of whether a better algorithm exists.
