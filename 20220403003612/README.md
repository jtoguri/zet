# What Are Commands?

A command can be one of four different things:
1. An executable program:
    * compiled binaries such as programs written in C and C++
    * programs written in scripting languages such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.
1. A command built into the shell itself. `bash` supports a number of commands internally called shell builtins.
1. A shell function; miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment.
1. An alias. Aliases are commands that we can define ourselves, built from other commands.
