# Expressing Algorithms

The three most common forms of algorithmic notation are:
1. English
1. pseudocode
1. a real programming language

Pseuocode can be defined as a programming language that never complains about syntax.

There is a tradeoff between greater ease of expression and precision. English is the most natural but least precise programming language, while a programming language like C is very precise but difficult to write and undertand. This leaves pseudocode as a happy medium.

Since the heart of any algorithm is an *idea*, it makes sense to start with algorithm expression in English, then move to a lower-level notation. If your idea is not clearly revealed when you express an algorithm, then you are using too low-level a notation to describe it.
