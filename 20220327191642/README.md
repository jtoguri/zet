# Filenames in Linux

>Filenames that begin with a period character are hidden.
> 
>Filenames and commands in Linux, like Unix, are case sensitive. The filenames “File1” and “file1” refer to different files.
>
>Linux has no concept of a “file extension”. You may name files any way you like. The contents and/or purpose of a file is determined by other means. Although Unix-like operating systems don’t use file extensions to determine the contents/purpose of files, many application programs do.
>
>Though Linux supports long filenames that may contain embedded spaces and punctuation characters, limit the punctuation characters in the names of files you create to period, dash, and underscore. Most importantly, do not embed spaces in filenames. If you want to represent spaces between words in a filename, use underscore characters.
