# Mathematical Proofs

A proper mathematical proof consists of several parts:
1. a clear, precise statement of what you are trying to prove
1. a set of assumptions of things that are taken to be true, and hence can be used as part of the proof
1. a chain of reasoning that takes you from these assumptions to the statement you are trying to prove
1. a little square (&#x220E;) or **QED** at the bottom to denote that you have finished, representing the Latin phrase for “thus it is demonstrated”

A proof is a *demonstration*.
